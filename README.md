## Create a branch
Go to repository on GitHub, click on iba-web, press main, create a branch from main and choose branch name. You have to start the branch with date,your own name and a very short description. For example: 29112022/filippa/start-button
### IMPORTANT! Before you push your code to main make sure to do a pull from main before so you always have the latest code.
